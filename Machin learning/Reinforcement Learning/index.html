                            <p class="context text-white">
                                Reinforcement Learning (RL) is the science of decision making. It is about learning the optimal behavior in an environment to obtain maximum reward. This optimal behavior is learned through interactions with the environment and observations of how it responds, similar to children exploring the world around them and learning the actions that help them achieve a goal.
                                <br>
                                In the absence of a supervisor, the learner must independently discover the sequence of actions that maximize the reward. This discovery process is akin to a trial-and-error search. The quality of actions is measured by not just the immediate reward they return, but also the delayed reward they might fetch. As it can learn the actions that result in eventual success in an unseen environment without the help of a supervisor, reinforcement learning is a very powerful algorithm.

                        <h3 class="header text-white">How Does Reinforcement Learning Work?</h3>
                            <p class="context text-white">
                                The Reinforcement Learning problem involves an agent exploring an unknown environment to achieve a goal. RL is based on the hypothesis that all goals can be described by the maximization of expected cumulative reward. The agent must learn to sense and perturb the state of the environment using its actions to derive maximal reward. The formal framework for RL borrows from the problem of optimal control of&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_decision_process">Markov Decision Processes</a>&nbsp;(MDP).
                                <br>
                                <h4 class="header text-white">The main elements of an RL system are:</h4>
                                <br>
                                <ol>
                                    <li>The agent or the learner</li>
                                    <li>The environment the agent interacts with</li>
                                    <li>The policy that the agent follows to take actions</li>
                                    <li>The reward signal that the agent observes upon taking actions</li>
                                    </ol>                        
                                <br>
                                <p class="context text-white">
                                A useful abstraction of the reward signal is the value function, which faithfully captures the ‘goodness’ of a state. While the reward signal represents the immediate benefit of being in a certain state, the value function captures the cumulative reward that is expected to be collected from that state on, going into the future. The objective of an RL algorithm is to discover the action policy that maximizes the average value that it can extract from every state of the system.
                                </p>

                                RL algorithms can be broadly categorized as model-free and model-based. Model-free algorithms do not build an explicit model of the environment, or more rigorously, the MDP. They are closer to trial-and-error algorithms that run experiments with the environment using actions and derive the optimal policy from it directly. Model-free algorithms are either value-based or policy-based. Value-based algorithms consider optimal policy to be a direct result of estimating the value function of every state accurately. Using a recursive relation described by&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bellman_equation">the Bellman equation</a>, the agent interacts with the environment to sample trajectories of states and rewards. Given enough trajectories, the value function of the MDP can be estimated. Once the value function is known, discovering the optimal policy is simply a matter of acting greedily with respect to the value function at every state of the process. Some popular value-based algorithms are&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State%E2%80%93action%E2%80%93reward%E2%80%93state%E2%80%93action">SARSA</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q-learning">Q-learning</a>. Policy-based algorithms, on the other hand, directly estimate the optimal policy without modeling the value function. By parametrizing the policy directly using learnable weights, they render the learning problem into an explicit optimization problem. Like value-based algorithms, the agent samples trajectories of states and rewards; however, this information is used to explicitly improve the policy by maximizing the average value function across all states. Popular policy-based RL algorithms include Monte Carlo policy gradient (REINFORCE) and deterministic policy gradient (DPG). Policy-based approaches suffer from a high variance which manifests as instabilities during the training process. Value-based approaches, though more stable, are not suitable to model continuous action spaces.&nbsp; One of the most powerful RL algorithms, called the actor-critic algorithm, is built by combining the value-based and policy-based approaches. In this algorithm, both the policy (actor) and the value function (critic) are parametrized to enable effective use of training data with stable convergence.

                            <p class="context text-white">
                                Any real-world problem where an agent must interact with an uncertain environment to meet a specific goal is a potential application of RL. Here are a few RL success stories:
                                <ul>
                                    <li><b>Robotics.&nbsp;</b>Robots with pre-programmed behavior are useful in structured environments, such as the assembly line of an automobile manufacturing plant, where the task is repetitive in nature. In the real world, where the response of the environment to the behavior of the robot is uncertain, pre-programming accurate actions is nearly impossible. In such scenarios, RL provides an efficient way to build general-purpose robots. It has been successfully applied to robotic path planning, where a robot must find a short, smooth, and navigable path between two locations, void of collisions and compatible with the dynamics of the robot.</li>
                                    <li><b>AlphaGo.&nbsp;</b>One of the most complex strategic games is a 3,000-year-old Chinese board game called Go. Its complexity stems from the fact that there are 10^270 possible board combinations, several orders of magnitude more than the game of chess. In 2016, an RL-based Go agent called AlphaGo defeated the greatest human Go player. Much like a human player, it learned by experience, playing thousands of games with professional players. The latest RL-based Go agent has the capability to learn by playing against itself, an advantage that the human player doesn’t have.</li>
                                    <li><b>Autonomous Driving.&nbsp;</b>An autonomous driving system must perform multiple perception and planning tasks in an uncertain environment. Some specific tasks where RL finds application include vehicle path planning and motion prediction. Vehicle path planning requires several low and high-level policies to make decisions over varying temporal and spatial scales. Motion prediction is the task of predicting the movement of pedestrians and other vehicles, to understand how the situation might develop based on the current state of the environment.</li>
                                    </ul>
                            </p>   
                            



                            <h3 class="header text-white">Challenges with Reinforcement Learning</h3>
                                <p class="context text-white">
                                    While RL algorithms have been successful in solving complex problems in diverse simulated environments, their adoption in the real world has been slow. Here are some of the challenges that have made their uptake difficult:
                                    <br>
                                    Algorithms commonly used in supervised learning programs include the following:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li><b>RL agent needs extensive experience.</b>&nbsp;RL methods autonomously generate training data by interacting with the environment. Thus, the rate of data collection is limited by the dynamics of the environment. Environments with high latency slow down the learning curve. Furthermore, in complex environments with high-dimensional state spaces, extensive exploration is needed before a good solution can be found.</li>
                                        <li><b>Delayed rewards.&nbsp;</b>The learning agent can trade off short-term rewards for long-term gains. While this foundational principle makes RL useful, it also makes it difficult for the agent to discover the optimal policy. This is especially true in environments where the outcome is unknown until a large number of sequential actions are taken. In this scenario, assigning credit to a previous action for the final outcome is challenging and can introduce large variance during training. The game of chess is a relevant example here, where the outcome of the game is unknown until both players have made all their moves.</li>
                                        <li><b>Lack of interpretability.&nbsp;</b>Once an RL agent has learned the optimal policy and is deployed in the environment, it takes actions based on its experience. To an external observer, the reason for these actions might not be obvious. This lack of interpretability interferes with the development of trust between the agent and the observer. If an observer could explain the actions that the RL agent tasks, it would help him in understanding the problem better and discovering limitations of the model, especially in high-risk environments.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </p>
